# prepare_data_4knn
This file is uesd to process some data for myself. <br>
It also a kind of practice for new guy for Python. <br>
I want to organise 10 prices from each file in sample directory as a set and get the changes (There will be 9 changes) and put those changes into a new file. Which will be used for KNN algorithm (which is not showed int this programme).
